# Authentication Fix - Password Issue Resolved ✅

## Problem Identified
The password verification was failing for existing users because the user data was stored **in-memory only**. When the development server restarted (which happens automatically during code changes), all user data was lost. This meant:

1. User registers → Password is hashed and stored in memory
2. Server restarts (during development) → All data is lost
3. User tries to login → User not found OR password mismatch

## Solution Implemented

### File-Based Persistent Storage
Changed from in-memory storage to **file-based storage** using `users.json`:

```typescript
// Location: app/data/users.json
// This file is automatically created and maintained
```

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. **auth.ts** - Added File Persistence
- `loadUsers()`: Loads user data from `users.json` on server start
- `saveUsers()`: Saves user data to `users.json` after registration
- Data persists across server restarts

#### 2. **Enhanced Logging**
Added console logs to help debug authentication:
```typescript
// Shows which users exist in the system
// Shows when passwords don't match
// Shows successful authentications
```

#### 3. **Data Directory Structure**
```
app/data/
├── cafes.ts          (existing cafe data)
├── users.json        (new - stores user accounts)
└── .gitignore        (prevents committing user data)
```

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Register a New User
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "ابدأ الآن"
3. Switch to "حساب جديد" tab
4. Enter email and password (6+ characters)
5. Click "إنشاء الحساب"

### 2. Verify Persistence
1. Check that `app/data/users.json` was created
2. Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
3. Restart the server: `npm run dev`

### 3. Login with Existing Account
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "ابدأ الآن"
3. Use "تسجيل الدخول" tab
4. Enter the same email and password from registration
5. **It should work now!** ✅

## Technical Details

### Password Hashing
- Uses SHA-256 via Web Crypto API
- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- Each password is hashed before storage

### Data Format (users.json)
```json
[
  {
    "id": "random_string",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "hashed_password_string",
    "name": "Optional Name",
    "phone": "Optional Phone",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-23T..."
  }
]
```

## Security Notes

⚠️ **For Development Only**
- This file-based storage is for development/testing
- In production, use a proper database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- The `.gitignore` prevents committing user data to Git

## What's Next?

For production deployment, consider:
1. **Database**: Use Prisma with PostgreSQL/MySQL
2. **Better Hashing**: Use bcrypt instead of SHA-256
3. **Session Management**: Use JWT or proper session store
4. **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration

---

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Users can now login successfully with their registered accounts, even after server restarts!
